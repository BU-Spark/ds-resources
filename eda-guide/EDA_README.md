# Getting Started With Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Description

This Jupyter Notebook aims to guide users through a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing 311 service requests from the City of Boston. It covers the fundamentals of EDA such as data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualization to uncover insights and trends within the service requests data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this tutorial is from Analyze Boston, the City of Boston's open data hub. The dataset comprises of 311 requests from various channels of engagement, which just means help with non-emergency city services/information.
